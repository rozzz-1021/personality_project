# Personality Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project explores a personality dataset to analyze the relationship between social behaviors, personality types, and social network size. Methods include EDA, regression modeling, K-means clustering, logistic regression, and decision tree analysis.

---

## Data Preparation

* Missing numerical values imputed using median.
* Categorical missing values replaced with "Unknown."
* Variables converted to appropriate data types (factor/numeric).

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Personality Type Distribution

* Nearly balanced distribution of extroverts and introverts.
* Extroverts tend to spend less time alone and attend more social events.

### Social Event Attendance & Feeling Drained

* Individuals who feel drained after events attend fewer social events.
* Those who do not feel drained are more socially active, suggesting self-selection or energy regulation.

## Regression Analysis

### Model 1: Personality Only

* Introverts have \~5.8 fewer friends than extroverts.
* Adjusted R²: 0.47.

### Model 2: Personality + Time Spent Alone

* Introvert status reduces friend circle size by \~3.2.
* Each extra hour spent alone reduces friends by \~0.53.
* Adjusted R²: 0.56.

### Model 3: Personality + Drained After Socializing + Time Spent Alone

* Best performance with Adjusted R²: 0.67.
* All parameters are statistically significant.

#### Model Comparison

| Model   | Adj. R² | AIC   | BIC   |
| ------- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| Model 1 | 0.47    | 14763 | 14781 |
| Model 2 | 0.56    | 13972 | 13996 |
| Model 3 | 0.67    | 13437 | 13473 |

### Interaction Effect

* Tested interaction between personality and alone time.
* Did not outperform Model 3.

---

## Backtesting

* Model 3 evaluated using 80/20 train-test split.
* RMSE: 2.37.

---

## Logistic Regression

* Predict personality type using social event attendance, friend circle size, and time spent alone.
* Accuracy: 0.94.

---

## K-means Clustering

* 3 clusters identified using K-means with PCA for visualization.
* Cluster sizes: 731, 1441, 728.
* Cluster 2 stands out; Clusters 1 and 3 overlap.

### Cluster Summary

* Cluster 2: higher alone time, smaller friend circles.

---

## Decision Tree Analysis

* Primary split: social event attendance ≥ 4.
* Secondary split for low attendance: time spent alone.
* High event attendance group predominantly extroverts; high alone time group predominantly introverts.

---

## Conclusion

Social behaviors like time spent alone and social event attendance are strong predictors of personality type and friend network size. Model 3 provides the best regression fit, and logistic regression further supports these insights with high accuracy.

## Next Steps

* Explore non-linear models or ensemble methods.
* Further examine overlapping clusters using silhouette scores.
* Consider additional behavioral or psychological variables.
