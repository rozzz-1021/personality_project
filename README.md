## Key Analyses

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Distribution plots, boxplots.
- **Regression models**: Linear regressions to analyze friend circle size.
- **Logistic regression**: Predict introvert/extrovert personality with 94% accuracy.
- **K-means clustering**: Segmentation into 3 groups with PCA visualization.
- **Decision tree**: Classify personality types based on behaviors.

## Results

- Introverts spend significantly more time alone and have smaller friend circles.
- Extroverts attend more social events and have larger friend networks.
- Time spent alone negatively correlates with friend circle size.
- Logistic regression achieves 94% accuracy in classifying personalities.
